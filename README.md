# QBRZoom
A Proof-of-Concept implementation of an LLM driven Portfoli Health Repoert tool for Quarterly Business Reviews

---

## Prerequisites

QBRZoom requires Python >= 3.9; it is developed and tested on Python 3.11.4.  

You also need:

- pip package manager  
- Git to clone or update the repository  
- A Hugging Face account  
- Request access to `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` on Hugging Face (approval may take several hours to days)

---

## Setup

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Isolate project dependencies in a dedicated virtual environment:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

- On macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Upgrade pip and install required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file pins all dependencies, including SpaCy, typing extensions, and other version constraints.

---

### 3. Download the SpaCy Model

Fetch SpaCy’s small English pipeline before the first run:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

This ensures all NLP features are available out of the box.

---

### 4. Initialize the Llama Model

Meta’s `Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` weights require explicit approval on Hugging Face. Access isn’t granted immediately—you must:

1. Log in (or sign up) at https://huggingface.co  
2. Request access to `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`  
3. Wait for approval (this can take a few hours to days)  
4. Once approved, run:

   ```bash
   python initialize.py
   ```

This script will prompt you for your Hugging Face token, download the model, and cache it locally for future use.

---

## Usage

With setup complete, launch the main application:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Artifacts

The repository produces and stores key outputs in the root folder:

- final_report.md  
  A human-readable summary generated by QBRZoom based on the given demo data.

- prompts_and_risks.zip  
  Contains the exact prompts sent to the LLM and the raw model responses. This ZIP is password protected; the password has been sent to you via email.
